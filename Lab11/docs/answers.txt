1. The net layer is used for the section for the supply rings.
2. Average width is about 9.9 micrometers. Spacing is about the same
3. Spacing between the inner supply ring and core area is 10. The command that controls this is
   the around default power domain command inside of supply_rings.tcl

2.2
1. The layout changed when a bunch of cells were placed on the inside block.
2. 70%
3. Now the cells are connected by physical wires with the sroute command, they are rather chained together by one grid
4. The blue wires connect the cells on the inside of the grid to the outside rails and the red ones
   connect cells vertically to other cells. The green ones horizantally connect the cells to their neighbors.
5. Around 80-90% seems to be filled. The sroute command definitely had a lot to do with the extra wires filling up the core.

3
1. DFFSR cell and DFFPOSX cell
2. 7 combinational blocks in between
3. fifo_reg4
4. The delay time is kind of different in that in the layout one it is 0.18 and the timing path analyzer one is -0.79, so there is a bit of discrepancy.


5. New skew is -0.62, so design is improved?
